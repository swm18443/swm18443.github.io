			<p>There are many different ducks that live in many different ecosystems. Some eat fish, some eat plants, and some eat insects.
		 The most common duck in the United States is the mallard (pictured above: the male is on the right and the female is on the left). Ducks are widely sought after all over the world for their meats and feathers.</p>

		 <p>Duck populations rely on their undeveloped breeding grounds in northern praries and lakes. On average, a female mallard duck will have six to eight eggs. But ducks have many predators ranging from foxes to Bald Eagles.</p>
		 <p>There are over a hundred different species of ducks, and all of them are spread out in different population sizes. But the top three highest duck populations in the US are as follows:</p>
